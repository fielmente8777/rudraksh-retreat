Mahesh, Roopali and Shubhang make you feel at home and like one of their family. The food is simply spectacular. Fresh, organic and delicious. The rooms are very comfortable and have an amazing mountain view. I recommend this place for those who want to know a piece of heaven on earth.",

          Go! Just go. It was the highlight of my month-long first time trip to India. These 2 reviews give a wonderfully detailed and accurate description of the place, that I don't need to repeat. (Anjita Shroff wrote a review Feb 2024) (Kim Sands wrote a review Jan 2024). I'll add that the owners have made a real commitment to being a responsible part of the community, hiring local people, helping teach the local people about products they can grow and helping them to find a market for them, partnering with the schools, etc. My favorite part of the stay was the quiet (hearing the chant of morning puja from the valley as the sun rose), and the joy watching some young schoolgirls do a folk dance. Again, just go!
